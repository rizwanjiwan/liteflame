### Lite Flame
This is basically me ripping off the idea and look of https://github.com/pawelmalak/flame
to make a plain html file that does basically the same thing without needing a 300mb docker
image/container running with node.js.

I made some changes too for my own needs:
- Removed the weather feature
- Changed the search to search the page rather than hit a search engine (I'd rather just use the built-in address bar search since it provides autocomplete against search engines)

To use this:
1. Clone the repo
2. Edit the index.html file and fill in the config object at the top.

The rest should just work then.
